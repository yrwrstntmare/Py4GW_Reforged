    55 HP Monk Farmer build with coordinated protection shields.

    This build coordinates Shielding Hands and Shield of Absorption to prevent
    overlap - only one protection shield is maintained at a time. Shielding Hands
    is preferred due to its longer duration, with Shield of Absorption used as
    a fallback when Shielding Hands is recharging.

    Supported skill variants:
    - Healing Breeze or Mystic Regeneration for regeneration
    - Mend Ailment, Dismiss Condition, or Smite Condition for condition removal

    Note: this is the D/Mo bar. The skills are all Monk-primary, so the bar is
    selected on Monk primary + Dervish secondary plus the template code above.
    The Mo/any variant is a separate build to be added once this one is working.

        than ENCHANT_REFRESH_FRACTION of the observed duration remains.

        That heuristic is wrong for any enchant whose duration is short relative
        to its recharge, because it can schedule the recast before the skill is
        even available. Protective Spirit and Mystic Regeneration both override
        it below.
        PS runs ~24s on a ~0.25s recharge, so the fraction rule recasts it with
        ~10.8s still up - over 11 wasted seconds in every 24s cycle. And since
        PS is first in the ladder, each of those early recasts evicts a shield,
        the regeneration, or a condition clear that would have been better spent.
        With a recharge this short relative to the duration there is no reason to
        refresh early at all: wait until PS is close to lapsing and spend the
        freed casts on the rest of the kit.

        The override is a remaining-time floor rather than a fraction, because
        the point is "PS is nearly gone", not "PS is at some proportion of a
        duration we would otherwise have to guess".
